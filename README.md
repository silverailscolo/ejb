### Features

#### Light/Dark Mode

This template has a built-in light/dark mode. It detects the user preferred color scheme and automatically switches to it. You can also manually switch between light and dark mode by clicking on the sun/moon icon in the top right corner of the page.

---

#### Atom (RSS-like) Feed

The Atom (RSS-like) feed is reachable simply by typing after your homepage `/feed.xml`. So you type `silverailscolo.github.io/ejb/feed.xml` in an appropriate app.

---

#### Related posts

There is a related posts section on the bottom of the blog posts. These are generated by selecting the `max_related` most recent posts that share at least `min_common_tags` tags with the current post.

---

#### Code quality checks

We run some checks to ensure that the code quality and generated site are good. The checks are done using GitHub Actions and the following tools:

- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - check if the formatting of the code follows the style guide
- [lychee](https://lychee.cli.rs/) - check for broken links
- [Axe](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) (need to run manually) - do some accessibility testing
