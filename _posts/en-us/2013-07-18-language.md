You can start writing a blog in a couple of clicks. But in what language am I advised to
write?

It may be wise to blog in English to reach my foreign railroading friends. But Dutch is
easier for blogging about everyday events. I'm afraid I'll start in Dutch, but please don't
hesitate to tune in if you prefer some items or a branch in English.

Update: Since 2024 using Jekyll a function called i18n (Internationalization) supports give
readers a choice of language.
