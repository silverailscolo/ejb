Tom Turner wrote a clear [essay](https://www.gardenvisit.com/history_theory/library_online_ebooks/architecture_city_as_landscape) on the history of urban planning and design.
The hierarchy of roads over housing over the garden needs reconsidering. The seductive
use of maps and words by politicians and designers may lead one to believe there is a
right and a wrong way of laying out squares and roads. But Turner makes a case for less
binary or-or mono-function and more diffuse categories. Bottom-up initiatives may aid us
as designers. Hands-on design is to be preferred over clean-hands off-site design.

Still, I find the structuring of spaces as put forward by Edmund Bacon an
inspiring method.
