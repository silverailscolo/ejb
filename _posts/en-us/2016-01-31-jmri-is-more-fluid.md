As a Christmas holiday project, I contributed to the JMRI manual and translations.
Fun, but it feels like lots of eyes are watching you (8,000 users worldwide!). JMRI
is developed using [Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html) with [GitHub](https://github.com/) as its Version Control System (VCS).
Genius!
