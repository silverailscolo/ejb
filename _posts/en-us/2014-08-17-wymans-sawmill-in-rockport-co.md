During 2 rainy days in my summer vacation I finally built the mill using plans from the
September 1976 Model Railroader magazine. The location in Rockport had been part of my
layout design since more than five years, but the detailed drawings I had studied over
and over for the last 40 years contained so much detail that this clearly was not a
beginner's model.

Windows are Grandt Line castings, some adapted by splitting and joining.
All doors were hand made from styrene or stripwood. My son suspects me to enter the
sawmill in some kind of modeller's competition and perhaps I will some day.
