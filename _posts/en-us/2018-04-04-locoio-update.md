I've built another HDL LocoIO board. Hope to configure it using JMRI 4.12.

Not yet in JMRI 4.11.6. I'm working to get the tool operating with the newer hardware.

Update: JMRI 4.15.5 contains more options to configure these boards, as well as HDL
LocoBooster and LocoServo boards (ports 1-5 to start with).

Please report your results!
