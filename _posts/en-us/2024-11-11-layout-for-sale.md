After taking down my N scale model railroad in the summer of 2021, I kept a few pieces as modules in storage.
Now that the house is finished and we are throwing out any surplus building supplies and other stuff, I felt a renewed interest in dusting them off.

Although it is lovely to have the best engines on display in my office, model railroading to me means moving things on rails, so I selected the Silverton and the Durenver modules, and part with the rest.

Two other modules, _Durango Yard_ and _Rockwood_, were up for sale on **Marktplaats**, where they get a lot of views, and even a couple of offers.

## Simple modules on strings

The modules I keep were stripped of the subframes and fastened to a pair of boards that are suspended from the ceiling, with a counterweight along the wall. When I want to run either module, I plug in the command station and go. Both the plywood railbed and a layer below that are hinged for easy access and troubleshooting.

Off we go!
