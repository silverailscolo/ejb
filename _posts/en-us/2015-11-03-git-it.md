To assist in the development of the [JMRI](http://jmri.org) Java application for running
trains, I signed on to [GitHub](http://www.github.com) and installed GitHub Desktop. I figured out how to
clone the original JMRI repository to my own GitHub remote repo. Creating a Branch to
write new or improved code for web pages and configuration files on GitHub web was next.

Then came the step to clone my remote repo to a local copy on my computer.
[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) looked like a perfect program to do this. So now I had a
large folder on my desktop with a copy of my repo, letting me edit any file directly
from the Finder in either Espresso or an image editing app. You need this local repo
1 to delete and add files anyway.

But when I added the Netbeans IDE there
was a mix-up in the source and target files. You save on disk space by pointing
NetBeans to local GitHub repo 1 as its Git master. But a Commit + Push in NetBeans
shows up like the exact opposite in GitHub Desktop: when I added a word in NB,
GitHub Desktop showed that Commit as deleting that word from the files it was
comparing. That setup with one index won't work!

So I suggest you let both Git clients clone the same remote repo. And only edit in
repo 2 inside NetBeans, not at a file level. Added benefit: this looks exactly the
same when you work on 2 computers, with your remote GitHub repo as the one and only
central place from which to make Pull Requests.

## _Oops_, a conflict?!

Whatever your workflow looks like, when you make a commit or update a branch from the
current upstream master, GitHub may signal a _conflict_ which you have to solve.
GitHub Web marks "a conflict" but doesn't tell you what or why. Open GitHub Desktop
to solve a conflict: scroll through the list to find the problematic file. To the
right look for the >>>>>>> mark(s). Right click and select "Show in Finder" and open
the file with your favorite editor. Choose which part to retain and what to delete.
Delete the >>> lines, Save and return to GitHub Desktop. Choose Commit to
\[your branch\], and Sync with your remote repo. You're ready to merge the Pull
Request.

Happy Gitting!
