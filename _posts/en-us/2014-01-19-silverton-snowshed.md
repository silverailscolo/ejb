Last weekend a lot happend in Silverton (level 2). After finishing the scenery and ballasting the track towards Ironton, I noted that at the left we had a disturbing lack of detail. The project to scratchbuild a snowshed over the SN track had intimidated me for years. But as always, you only discover how much work is involved by starting on a job. Plans for the snowshed had been drawn and copied some time ago, and enough stripwood from Black Bear was available. After the first 3 frames were placed on the foundation, I was hooked. Before midnight the whole structure was ready. Testing with a medium size RS3 diesel engine and a 40' car was essential to adjust some posts. NBW provide the necessary detail, as long as it can be seen.

To keep the momentum, I moved to the next item that spoiled every view of level 2.
The SN engine house, a Gloor Craft kit, had been nothing but a cardboard mockup for 5
years. As this was one of the first craftsman type kits I bought, cutting out the
openings for doors and windows seemed too scary at the time. With the introduction
of far more detailed laser-cut kits such as those by [Blair Line](https://www.blairline.com/) and Bar Mills
it's not as intimidating anymore. And the Gloor Crafts kit wasn't that difficult either.
Following the instructions, using the color scheme of the D&S NG, the engine house is
in the right spot to attract the eye between the tunnel portal and the town of Silverton.
