I already had HomeAssistant running at home. Using so-called _Integrations_ you can link various 'smart' hardware brands to it. What 'smart' devices do you have in your home? Manufacturer sometimes offers an app to control the device. This often works with a cloud (server via the internet): security risk, and depending on what the manufacturer shows data in the app. A few examples:
- Ikea Tradfri: **Ikea Smart** app + Tradfri hub
- Tuya Smart: **Tuya** app + Tuya bridge
- Nibe heat pump: **MyUplink** app + UTP
- Luxaflex shutters: **PowerView** app + bridge
- Casambi lamps (bluetooth): **Air** app + iPhone as BLE bridge
- Honeywell thermostat, Itho ventilation: **evohome** + RF bridge 

Some manufacturers share the data their app uses as an application programming interface [(]API](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) to which HA can connect. If they don't, you have to find out for yourself what the visible data mean and how you can imitate it. When they apply advanced _encryption_, reverse-engineering is nearly impossible!

Open source, people code Integrations for  [HomeAssistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) (HA). I have installed a few in HA, such as PowerView and Ikea Tradfri. From a privacy and security standpoint it is preferred to connect directly to a device, bypassing the API. 

For our [Nibe F1255](https://www.nibe.eu/nl-nl/producten/warmtepompen/water-water-warmtepompen/f1255-pc) heat pump there is a Swedish program that is connected to the ModBus connection instead of via the API, and sends and receives messages to MQTT via Wi-Fi on a [PiZero](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w/) microcontroller.

Our HRV fans in the bathroom, bedroom and living room come with an (expensive €100) wireless RF switch. But wouldn't it be useful to switch them on at certain times, e.g. when you turn on the light in the toilet, or in the morning after getting up on high for an hour?

The manufacturers did not provide any technical information about how the switches "talk" to the fans. On the contrary, they prefer not to have you touch their default settings for fear that complaints will arise. And they want to make money from their "knowledge" by shielding it and only giving professional mechanics this information. And they don't like to share that info either (if they are allowed to do so at all).

So I opened my [ClimaRad](https://www.climarad.nl/) HRU - which did not come with a remote control - myself and found a circuit board with an antenna there. Through the stickers I learned that it was an RF antenna and that the print was produced by [Airios] in Holland.

A phone call to Airios didn't help: "contact ClimaRad". [Airios](https://www.airios.eu/) appears to be originally the consumer branch of Honeywell/[Resideo](https://www.resideo.com/nl/nl/). And with that info I ended up with the open source HA integration [Ramses RF](https://github.com/ramses-rf), written in python by David Bonnes.

From 2021 onwards, David Bonnes and Peter Price figured out the messages they received with an 868MHz antenna (Ramses-II protocol). They developed the first hardware and software to control heating and DHW (hot tap water) as (evohome; HEAT). Dutch users supplemented the code to also control ventilation ([Itho](https://www.ithodaalderop.nl/), [Orcon](https://orcon.nl/), [Nuaire](https://www.nuaire.co.uk/); HVAC).

But our fans and heat recovery units (NL: WTW, EN: HRU for heat recovery unit) from Vasco and ClimaRad did not work with Ramses RF at the time, so I started writing extra code for that. When that code worked well here in the house, I asked David if he wanted to include the code in a new version that all users can install. But he was concerned that my changes could cause problems with other users. He also indicated that his work meant that he had too little time to keep Ramses RF up-to-date and wrote in the code that he wanted to transfer everything to a new administrator. After 4 months, I took over that task from David in mid-2025. Due to announced changes in HomeAssistant, the Ramses RF integration would no longer work by the end of 2025, so those became my new priorities:
- [x] Blocking file IO during startup
- [x] Outdated (non) entity schemas

Unfortunately, I also discovered that I could not control my ClimaRad Ventura HRVU with Ramses RF (I can read it, but you can't connect a remote to it). Someone in Spain happened to have come up with something for that at the beginning of 2025: the PyAirios library and airios HA-integrate, which I discovered by searching for "airios + ramses".
