With a lot of help from my son I managed to clean up my desk after years of neglect.
Sorting some bolts and nuts, and putting the remainders of several 'open' projects in
small plastic trays made room for a fresh look at the hobby.

And I kitbashed the Newport Ice and Fish Company straight away.

Thanks, C.!
