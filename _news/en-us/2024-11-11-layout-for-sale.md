After taking down my N scale model railroad in the summer of 2021, I kept a few pieces as modules in storage.
Now that the house is finished and we are throwing out any surplus building supplies and other stuff, I felt a renewed interest in dusting them off.

Although it is lovely to have the best engines on display in my office, model railroading to me means moving things on rails, so I selected the Silverton and the Durenver modules, and part with the rest.

Two other modules, [Durango Yard](https://www.marktplaats.nl/v/hobby-en-vrije-tijd/modeltreinen-n-spoor/m2177277613-n-module-durango-co-usa-incl-gebouwtjes) and [Rockwood](https://www.marktplaats.nl/v/hobby-en-vrije-tijd/modeltreinen-n-spoor/m2176141841-n-module-berglandschap-high-line-incl-gebouwtjes), are currently for sale on [Marktplaats](https://www.marktplaats.nl/u/e-broerse/7983972/), where they get a lot of views, and even a couple of offers.

## Simple modules on strings

The modules I keep were stripped of the subframes and fastened to a pair of boards that are suspended from the ceiling, with a counterweight along the wall. When I want to run either module, I plug in the command station and go. Both the plywood railbed and a layer below that are hinged for easy access and troubleshooting.

Off we go!
