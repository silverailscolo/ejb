I rounded up migrating my website, blog and photo library as an integrated experience served from Jekyll. Goodbye Wordpresse and Piwigo updates and security side jobs.

I serve two languages: NL and EN-US, originally for my US model railroad stuff. And you can choose from Light and Dark theme.

Also includes captions read directly from image file metadata (sorry, these are not i18n. I tried, but that was too much for now).

Have a look around, and report any - serious - hick-ups as an [Issue](https://github.com/silverailscolo/ejb/issues)
